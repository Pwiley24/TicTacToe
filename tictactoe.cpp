//Basic Idea for Tic Tac Toe:

// create a 4x4 grid
//  1  2  3
//a
//b
//c

//within a while game is playing = true
  //let a user choose a spot
  //check if valid (equals a blank space)
  //if x's turn place an x otherwise place an o
  //check for x wins/y wins/ties
  //switch to other's turn

//to check for x wins/ y wins (two functions: one for x checks, one for y)
  //go through all spots:
    //if winning spots are ocupied return (x or y) winner depending on which function is performing
